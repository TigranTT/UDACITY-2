<h1>Lesson 1</h1>

HTML is <b>reasonably</b> straight forward
<br>
<br>
<br>
	
	The tag B makes it <b>bold</b><br>
	The tag EM makes it <em>italic</em><br>
	<p>The tag BR ends the line.</p>
	<p>Also tag BR is a void tag since it doesn't need closing tag.</p>
	<p>Another good example of void tag is IMG, unless like tag P, which needs closing tag.</p> 
	<p>Tag BR stands for "brake" and tag P for "paragraph".</p>
	<p>Got to watch to type correct code since the computer is not smart enough to correct me,<br>
		unless this program "TextMate" that at least shows these tags in different colors.</p> 
	<p>What else did I learn on this class....</p>
	<p>Elements can be in 2 types "inline" and "block"</p>
	<p>Examples of inline elements completed by tags BR, A, B, EM, STRONG <br>
		and examples of block elements with tags like FORM, P,</p>
	<p>Learned also about attributes like the "href" that can be used with tag A to create a link to a website</p>
	<p>Another attribute is "src" that can be used with tag IMG to show the path to the picture file.</p>

	  <p>So far I like the <b>programming</b>, can't remember what I got intimidated by many years back when I chose the<br><strong>networking</strong> path as my career. I like Andy's approach on learning things.<br> Hopefully it will go smooth this time.</p>

	<h2>Lesson 2</h2>
<p><b>structure of HTML</b></p>
<div>
	<p>HTML is the main structure<br>
		CSS is the color and decoration</p>
	<p>Using google chrome to follow the structure with "Developer Tool"</p>
	<p>Breaking and shaping the website in to multiple boxes</p> 
</div>	
<div>
	<p>Using the <b>Right click</b> on each item can <b>inspect</b> the element</p>
	<p>I like the part when you can see each element while dragging the mouse over it</p>
	<p>Learn how to read the CSS part of the code in "style" atribute to see the color,size...</p>
